## How do you count the number of people accessing a room, in order to display it to the people in the room, but also to keep statistics over the longer term?

Work only on linux with ncurse library installed. Compiled and Run "votre_prog.cpp" to start the generation.
The generated maze it's a perfect maze (starting from any box you can go to any box). The generation is totally random.
To win, you must go to the bottom right box.
You can push F1 to give up and see a maze solution generated live.
